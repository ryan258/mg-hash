      </ul>

        Wisconsin - Madison and DePaul University, respectively. Mike is a lifelong learner and with a passion around conflict
        resolution. Mike focuses on neuroscience applications, the IRS and being a solution provider.</p>
      <h2>Volunteer Activities</h2>
      <p>Mike regularly volunteers as a mediator (Dispute Resolution Center) in public housing, housing court, conciliation
        court, neighborhood disputes and as a volunteer circle keeper and facilitator with various communities on very sensitive

      <p>Mike brings a passion for learning and to share what he has learned.</p>
      <p>Mike was an IRS civil servant of the year twice at the IRS: once as a front line manager early in his career at the
        IRS, and once at the end of his career as a territory manager. Mike was humbled and extremely honored by this recognition,
        since employees have to make the nomination to the executive level.</p>
      <p>Mike’s breakthrough experience relating to conflict resolution took place when he came to a district as an acting assistant
        director with 1,200 employees that had over 300 unfair labor practice complaints, grievances and EEO complaints.
        Mike worked with the director to address these systemically partnering with leadership, Human Resources, Equal Employment
        Opportunity, Labor Relations and the union training strategic stakeholders in mediation techniques and processes
        over a 4 ½ month time frame and left with less than 30 remaining. The district had a coffee for Mike when Mike left.
        Coffees in similar situations previously took about an hour and maybe 20 people showed up. This coffee took over
        6 hours with over 400 employees thanking Mike for making a real difference in their lives. This changed Mike’s life
        as an executive and drives Mike’s passion today to address conflict.</p>
      <p>A little known fact about Mike is that he made his first jump from an airplane when he was 19.</p>
      <p>Mike’s wife says Mike really does not work for a living, he just has fun, and she is right.</p>
      <p>Mike has been married over 30 years, has two married children and regularly plays with his two grandchildren</p>
      <p>These are covers of four of Mike’s more popular books.</p>
      <p>(Include Business Valuations and the IRS: Five books in one)</p>
