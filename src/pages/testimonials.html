              <p>I have had the privilege to work with Michael Gregory, ASA AVA MBA, on several occasions. Health Capital Consultants

                and experienced counsel were invaluable in our efforts to insure that our analysis and report were not only
                in compliance with professional standards, but were sharply focused on specific issues most likely to arise
                in the course of the deposition and trial phases of the project.</p>
              <p>Throughout our engagement, he exhibited the highest level of professionalism and integrity. He was accessible
                and timely as our various needs and requests for assistance arose during the course of our work. His comments,
